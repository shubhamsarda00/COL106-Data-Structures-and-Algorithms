# Assignment 4

In this assignment, Weak-AVL (WAVL) trees have been implemented to be used as a sorted Map. WAVL tree, a variant of AVL tree, is a balanced binary search tree. Theoretically, it is more efficient than AVL trees and Red-Black trees for insertions and deletions.

In the next part of the assignment, Hashmap, with open addressing and linear probing, has been been implmented to be used as an unsorted Map. It has been then used to solve the word counter problem

Finally, performance of both maps have been compared for insertion/deletion operations in "Map.java".
