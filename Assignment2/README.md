# Assignment 2

In this assignnment, we've created a MyStack class which is essentially an array based generic stack implementation. We've used to same to develop a calculator (MyCalculator.java) which inputs arithmetic expression in the form of a String. We've also implemented the stack sort algorithm (sorting an array using single stack) in StackSort.java. More details in "Assignment2-COL106.pdf".
