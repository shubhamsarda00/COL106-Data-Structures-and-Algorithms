# Assignment 5
In this assignment, "StockMgmt" class has been implemented to maintain/update stock data for a warehouse containing items of different categories. Purchase history for each item of any category is also maintained separately. Several query functions such as returning sorted list of items of given category(s) based on last date of purchase, stock left, purchase activity in a given period etc. have also been implemented by using mergesort (implemented in LLMergeSort class).
