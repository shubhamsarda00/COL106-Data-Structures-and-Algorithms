# Assignment 6

In this assignment, Pseudo-dual directed graphs have been constructed for modeling road networks in the form of rectangular grids. The pseudo-dual graphs help to incorporate turn penalties (cost of turning) in the graph itself. Finally, Dijkstra's algorithm has been used to find minimum cost path between any two junctions on the road network.
