# Assignment 3

In this assignment, java implementations of binary search tree and max heap have been created. Note that unlike conventional BSTs and Heaps, the ordering of a {key, value} pair has been done using "value" instead of the "key". Functions implemented are given in separate interface files for both the data structures. 

These implementations have been utilised in the Election class for maintaining/updating voting data of election candidates belonging to different parties/states/constituencies/districts. The class also handles queries such as top k candidates in constituency, leading party in state/country, vote share of a given party, cancelling canditates from a particular constituency due to electoral fraud etc. More details in "Assignment3.pdf"
