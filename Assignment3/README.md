# Assignment 3

In this assignment, java implementations of binary search tree and max heap have been created. Note that unlike conventional BSTs and Heaps, the ordering of a {key, value} pair has been done using "value" instead of the "key". Functions implemented are given in separate interface files for both the data structures. More details in "Assignment3.pdf"
